# The solutions are compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

 #  Some tips:
 
 # # The Tests
 # 1. While running the tests first you must include catch.hpp in your projects.
 # 2. Add xxxxx.h  and Test- xxxxx.cpp to the project where xxxxx is the name of the problem.
 # 3. Run.
 
 # # The programs
 # 1. Add xxxxx.h and Main- xxxxx.cpp to your project ( xxxxx is the name of the task ).
 # 2. Run. While running the programs first you must enter a positive integer N and then following N lines with your data.
 
 
 # Note : Please do not run both .cpp files at the same time( Main and Test corresponding to the tasks). If you want to run Main-xxxxx.cpp files please remove the Test-xxxxx.cpp from your project - and the opposite.
 
# About Catch2:
# Catch2 is a multi-paradigm test framework for C++. Catch2 is header only. All you need to do is drop the file somewhere reachable from the project - either in some central location you can set the header search path to find, or directly into the project tree itself. More information about it you can find at https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 .
